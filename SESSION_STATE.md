## Current Project Status

**Project**: RLC Bingo Manager V2
**Version**: v2.3.17
**Last Deployment**: Commit `a9a4087` - October 10, 2025 17:20 CST
**Status**: Testing phase - critical redirect issue identified

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed Today

### 1. Dashboard Table Display (v2.3.14) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Occasions Management table showing "Unknown", "N/A", "$0" for all fields despite correct data in backend.

**Root Cause**: api-service.js transforms backend nested JSON to flat structure, but dashboard.js was reading from nested structure that no longer existed.

**Solution**:
- Added `lionPullTabs` and `totalOverShort` extraction to api-service.js
- Updated dashboard.js to read from flat transformed structure (occasion.sessionType, occasion.lionInCharge, etc.)

**Files Modified**:
- js/api-service.js (lines 116-122, 147, 154, 158)
- js/dashboard.js (lines 117-144)
- js/ui-components.js (matching changes)

**Verification**: User confirmed "dashboard table displays correct data" ‚úÖ

---

### 2. Landing Page URLs (v2.3.16) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: QR codes and URLs pointing to old v1 project (rlc-bingo-manager) instead of v2 (rlc-bingo-manager-v2).

**Solution**: Updated all 4 URL references in index.html

**Files Modified**:
- index.html (lines 234, 256, 267, 291)

**Status**: May still be cached by GitHub Pages CDN (5-10 minute propagation)

---

### 3. Version Numbers (v2.3.17) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Occasion entry page showing v2.3.10 instead of current version.

**Solution**: Updated hardcoded version in occasion.html header

**Files Modified**:
- occasion.html (line 429)

**Verification**: User confirmed "Versions are now correct" ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ùå Critical Issues - STILL BROKEN

### 1. Post-Submission Redirect - NOT WORKING ‚ùå
**Problem**: After submitting an occasion (especially when editing from admin), page reloads the same occasion in edit mode instead of redirecting to landing page (index.html).

**Expected Behavior**: Submit ‚Üí Redirect to index.html (landing page)
**Actual Behavior**: Submit ‚Üí Reloads same occasion as draft in edit mode

**Attempted Fixes**:
- v2.3.15: Changed `window.location.reload()` to `window.location.href = 'index.html'` - FAILED
- v2.3.17: Enhanced with:
  - Clear occasion ID from window.app.data
  - Use `window.location.replace()` with absolute URL
  - Build URL from origin + pathname
- **Still not working after v2.3.17 deployment**

**User Quote**: "Nope still reacts exactly the same"

**Code Location**: js/wizard.js lines 2787-2800
```javascript
alert('Occasion submitted successfully!');

// Clear draft data
localStorage.removeItem(CONFIG.STORAGE_KEYS.DRAFT_DATA);

// Clear any saved occasion ID to prevent reload
if (window.app && window.app.data) {
    delete window.app.data.id;
}

// Redirect to home page after successful submission
// Use replace() to remove from history and ensure clean navigation
const baseUrl = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname.substring(0, window.location.pathname.lastIndexOf('/'));
window.location.replace(baseUrl + '/index.html');
```

**Possible Root Causes to Investigate**:
1. Something is preventing the redirect from executing
2. Page is reloading before redirect completes
3. localStorage or session storage is being restored after redirect
4. URL parameters are being re-applied after redirect
5. Service worker or PWA manifest is interfering
6. Event listener is preventing navigation

**Next Step**: Add comprehensive diagnostic console logging to trace execution flow

---

### 2. Backend Submission Status - UNKNOWN STATUS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**User Quote**: "I do not think the Submission backend script is working as anticipated"

**Context**: User mentioned this but had to leave before providing details.

**What We Know**:
- Backend has diagnostic logging already deployed (from earlier session)
- Backend Code.js has extensive logging in doPost and handleSaveOccasionV2
- Logs should show status field handling

**What We Need**:
- Specific details on what's not working
- Console logs from submission attempt
- Backend execution logs from Google Apps Script

**Backend Logging Added** (deployed earlier):
- Code.js lines 95-110: JSONP parameter logging
- Code.js lines 1107-1115: occasionData parsing logging
- Code.js lines 1133-1157: Status field application logging

---

## üìã Pending Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Fix post-submission redirect** - Add diagnostic logging, trace execution flow
2. **Investigate backend submission** - Need user feedback on what's broken

### Medium Priority
3. **Verify landing page URLs** - Wait for GitHub CDN propagation, test QR codes
4. **Test complete workflow** - End-to-end testing after fixes

## üîç Diagnostic Strategy for Next Session

### 1. Add Console Logging to submitOccasion()

Add logging at each step:
```javascript
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Starting submission process');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: User confirmed');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Recalculated financials');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Set status to submitted');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Prepared submission data');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Sending to backend...');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Backend response received:', result);
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Clearing localStorage');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Clearing occasion ID from window.app.data');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Building redirect URL:', baseUrl);
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: About to redirect to:', baseUrl + '/index.html');
console.log('üöÄ SUBMIT: Calling window.location.replace()');
```

### 2. Check for Redirect Blockers

Investigate:
- Service worker (js/offline.js)
- PWA manifest (manifest.json)
- beforeunload event listeners
- Page reload triggers
- localStorage restoration on page load

### 3. Test Different Redirect Methods

Try alternatives:
- `window.location.assign()`
- `window.location = url`
- Add delay before redirect: `setTimeout(() => window.location.replace(url), 100)`
- Disable alert before redirect (alert might interfere)

### 4. Check URL Parameter Handling

Verify checkAndLoadOccasionFromUrl() (wizard.js:2869):
- Is it running after redirect?
- Is it finding occasion data somewhere?
- Add logging to this function

## üí¨ User Context

### Recent User Quotes
- "dashboard table displays correct data" ‚úÖ
- "Versions are now correct" ‚úÖ
- "Nope still reacts exactly the same" (referring to redirect issue) ‚ùå
- "I do not think the Submission backend script is working as anticipated" ‚ö†Ô∏è
- "Lets pause for now. I have to run errands"
- "I really need to close VS Code as if I dont, there are rendering issues when I open my laptop without the two external monitors connected"

### User Workflow Being Tested
1. Open admin dashboard
2. Click "Edit" on an occasion (e.g., 2025-07-14)
3. URL becomes: `occasion.html?date=2025-07-14&id=OCC_1760032241928`
4. Make changes (or not)
5. Click "Submit Occasion"
6. **EXPECTED**: Redirect to index.html (landing page)
7. **ACTUAL**: Page reloads with same occasion in edit mode

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps When Resuming

1. **Add diagnostic logging** to submitOccasion() function to trace execution
2. **Check for redirect blockers** (service worker, PWA, event listeners)
3. **Test alternative redirect methods** if current approach isn't executing
4. **Ask user for backend submission details** - what specifically isn't working?
5. **Test complete submission flow** with console open to capture logs

## üìù Notes for Claude

- User is experiencing monitor rendering issues with VS Code
- Session will be resumed after user returns from errands
- Critical focus: Fix post-submission redirect (highest priority)
- Backend submission issue needs more details from user
- All code changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
- Backend diagnostic logging is deployed and ready to use
- User confirmed dashboard is working correctly now
